This version of the report has been submitted independatly of the other group members. At the current moment, they are still working on it
We have decided as a team that I will cover the LRU algorithm code and its respective section in the report.

Explanation of how code compiles:
g++ lru.cpp -o lru

To Run:
./lru <tracefile_name> <number of frames> <mode>

The comments on the code itself should be sufficient in explaining the steps behind the algorithm.
